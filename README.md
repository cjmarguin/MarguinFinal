# Notes

Found issues: I can't quite figure out why I'm having a "heroku logs --tail" issue with heroku.  I had
updated the package.json file as instructed and attempted every solution I had known to resolve
the issue. After spending almost an hour attempting to 
fix the issue, I decided it'd be best to move-on.
My dearest apologies.
